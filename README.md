##  Core Features

### ðŸ”¹ Simple Proration Page (Home)

* **Smart Week Splitting**  
  Automatically separates any week that spans across months into two rows.  
  *Example: A week starting Jan 29th is split into 3 days for January and 4 days for February.*

* **Proportional Value Distribution**  
  Distributes numeric values across split weeks based on calendar day count.

* **Dual-Engine Performance**  
  - **Polars** for ultra-fast, parallel `.csv` processing  
  - **Pandas** for robust `.xlsx` (Excel) file compatibility

* **Built-in Verification**  
  Ensures the total sum of the selected value column remains unchanged after processing.

### ðŸ”¹ Holiday-Aware Proration Page

* **Intelligent Holiday Impact Modeling**  
  Uses **Prophet** to learn the multiplicative effect of weekends and public holidays from historical data.

* **Weighted Proration**  
  Splits weekly values using a "business effort" score per dayâ€”adjusting for holiday and weekend impact.

* **Dynamic Model Management**  
  Train and save multiple models (e.g., per country or business unit) and choose the appropriate one when processing new files.

* **Advanced Visual Analytics**  
  Generates comparison charts to visualize the difference between simple and holiday-aware proration, with toggle options for **monthly** and **weekly** views.
